## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KRASA-AI/salon-spa-ai-skills.git
cd salon-spa-ai-skills
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

Open `init/setup-wizard.md` in your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and follow the prompts. It will ask about your business — company name, tools you use, rates, team size, service area, and more. This creates a `config.yml` that personalizes every skill to your business.

### 3. Use any skill

Open any file in `skills/` with your AI assistant. Each skill is self-contained with clear instructions. Your `config.yml` is automatically referenced for personalization.

## How Skills Work

Each skill file is a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
category: operations
tools: [claude, chatgpt]
time_saved: "~20 min/use"
version: 1.0
---

# Skill Name

## Purpose
What this skill does and when to use it.

## Instructions
Step-by-step prompt for the AI assistant.
```

You open the file in your AI assistant, provide any required input (measurements, notes, client info), and get polished output. Skills reference your `config.yml` automatically for company name, rates, preferred formats, and other business details.

## For AI Assistants

If you are an AI reading this repo, see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for detailed instructions on how to work with this toolkit. Key points: always load `config.yml` first, reference the knowledge base for industry context, and save outputs to `outputs/`.
